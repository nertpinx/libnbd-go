This is an automatically updated repository of libnbd bindings built from the
upstream repository located at:

  https://github.com/libguestfs/libnbd

Everything under `/pkg` is generated from that repository and changes to those
files should be made only through changes in the original repository.  This
repository exists purely to ease the usability of libnbd go code so that it can
be consumed in the standard go-style fashion.
